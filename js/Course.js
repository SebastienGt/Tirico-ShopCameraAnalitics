// We use the modern version of JS so let's specify it : 
"use strict"; 



// To initalise Variable use let :
let Variable1;
Variable1 = "Hi master";
let Variable2 = 0;
alert(Variable1 + "                                                                   " + 1000/Variable2);
const Variable3 = 1, Variable4 = 2;

/* There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:

The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
The first character must not be a digit. 

When the name contains multiple words, camelCase is commonly used. That is: words go one after another, each word except first starting with a capital letter: myVeryLongName.

Case matters
Variables named apple and AppLE are two different variables.

let planeteName = "Terre";

/* Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are called “dynamically typed”, meaning that there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.
