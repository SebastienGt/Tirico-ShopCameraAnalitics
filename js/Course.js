// We use the modern version of JS so let's specify it : 
"use strict"; 


/*
// To initalise Variable use let :
let Variable1;
Variable1 = "Hi master";
let Variable2 = 0;
//alert(Variable1 + "                                                                   " + 1000/Variable2);
let Variable3 = 1, Variable4 = 2;

 There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:

The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
The first character must not be a digit. 

When the name contains multiple words, camelCase is commonly used. That is: words go one after another, each word except first starting with a capital letter: myVeryLongName.

Case matters
Variables named apple and AppLE are two different variables.
 Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are called “dynamically typed”, meaning that there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.


let planeteName = "Terre";
let isBoss = confirm("Are you the boss?");

alert( 'Right your are the ' + isBoss +" Boss here !" ); // true if OK is pressed*/
